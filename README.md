# DesktopCalc :bar_chart:
A very simple calculator written in C# with WPF.

# Motivation
The built-in Windows calculator lacks some features I desire, for example always staying on top
or easy to go back and change some numbers. So I quickly made this very simple application adding
all the features I wish Windows calculator had, it's as easy as that. :tada:

# Features
Simply write your expression in the bottom text box and the result will get calculated as you write it!
* The window will always stay on top.
* You can drag the window around by left-click dragging it.
* With middle mouse button you can close it.

# Editions
Check out the crypto branch to find a version of this calculator with some crypto currency functionality!

# Dependencies
[NCalc](https://ncalc.codeplex.com/) is used for evaluating the mathematical expressions.


And yes the font is Comic Sans. :grin:
