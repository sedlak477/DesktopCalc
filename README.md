# DesktopCalc - Crypto Edition :money_with_wings:
A very simple calculator written in C# with WPF.

# Crypto
This version of the calculator is basicly the same as the base version but with a grid added to
it's side with current crypto currency data (value of various coins).


**You can double click cells with a value in them to quickly append them to your expression!**


The data is provided by [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) public data API.  
This implies the rate limit of **10 requests per minute** also applies here.


# Motivation
The built-in Windows calculator lacks some features I desire, for example always staying on top
or easy to go back and change some numbers. So I quickly made this very simple application adding
all the features I wish Windows calculator had, it's as easy as that. :tada:

# Features
Simply write your expression in the bottom text box and the result will get calculated as you write it!
* The window will always stay on top.
* You can drag the window around by left-click dragging it.
* With middle mouse button you can close it.

# Dependencies
It uses NCalc for evaluating the mathematical expressions.


And yes the font is Comic Sans. :grin:
